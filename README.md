## Puzzles
In main.py, I have commented out some starting code for these puzzles. <br />
Write your code in these sections and uncomment them. <br />
I have provided some examples of similar functions to what each puzzle is asking for. Learn to read the code and modify it. <br />

At the very bottom, I have listed the functions. Comment and uncomment them, to run them one at a time.

```
# Run the puzzles

    example_a()
    # puzzle_a()

    example_b()
    # puzzle_b()

    example_c()
    # puzzle_c()
```


### A - Knock, Knock
Write a knock, knock joke using while loops <br />
"Knock, Knock!: " <br />
"who's there?" <br />
"Phil.... :" <br />
"phil who?" <br />
"Phil Deez Nuts!" <br />
The user should be continually prompted until they enter "who's there" or "who is there?" and "phil who?" <br />
If the user enters the wrong reply 2 times, tell them to write "who is there?" or "phil who?" <br />


### Puzzle B - While there's maths
Write a program that asks the user for a number between 1 and 10, then display the number to the power of 2,3,4 and 5. <br />
"Enter a number: "   2 <br />
"2 to the power of 2 is 4" <br />
"2 to the power of 3 is 8" <br />
... <br />
Continually prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. <br />
Think of how this would be done in an IF statement, then just do it in a while loop - while(if statement expression) <br />
Use Math.Pow() to do the power calculation. <br />
Math.Pow() accepts DOUBLES not ints. <br />


### C - Contagious Laughter
Write a program that maniacally laughs at the user, as long as the user keeps laughing. <br />
The program will say "Ha ha ha ha ha... " and if the user enters a string that contains "ha" the program will laugh again. <br />
Hint: Look up "Contains()" <br />
After laughing 3 times, the program should display "Ha ha???..." and if the user enters a string containing "ha" then keep laughing! <br />
Use a keepLaughing boolean value to continually re-run a while loop. <br />


# Good Luck!
